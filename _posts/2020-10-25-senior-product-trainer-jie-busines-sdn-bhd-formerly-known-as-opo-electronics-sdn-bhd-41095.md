<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div>OPPO is a global registered technology brand, with a long history of serving customers in North America, Europe and Asia, delivering products that receive high ratings from experts around the world.</div>
<div><br>
Since entering the mobile market in 2008, we have been restless in our pursuit of the latest technology, the highest quality and the most user friendly products.</div>
<div><strong>Leaders in Technology</strong><br>
We are passionate about exploring the latest that technology has to offer. Since the start, our products have pushed the boundaries of technology. An example is the 6.65mm OPPO Finder we released in mid-2012, then the world&#8217;s thinnest smartphone. Towards the end of 2012, we announced one of the world&#8217;s most anticipated smartphones, the OPPO Find 5, featuring a 5&#8221; 1080p and a 13 megapixel stacked CMOS sensor, it was the world&#8217;s first smartphone with hardware supported HDR.</div>
<div><strong>The Highest Quality Standards</strong><br>
OPPO uses the highest quality components available on the market. Alliances with the leading international partners ensure that we have the latest and best hardware available. With an uniquely independent R&amp;D capacity, we design, develop, manufacture, market, and sell our products ourselves.</div>
<div><br>
We have full control over the entire supply chain, from our factories to the hands of our customers. This way, we can design for the end product in mind and ensure that only the best quality products reach our customers.</div>
<div><strong>Customers First</strong><br>
Our customers are the core of our business, and satisfying them is the precondition to our existence. OPPO products are co-developed with our customers, with customer feedback playing a big role in both hardware and software development. For our smartphones, we have adopted rapid release cycles, releasing a weekly firmware update based on customer feedback.</div>
